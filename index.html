<p class="subtitle">How Appliances Should Be</p>

<section>

<p>PCD is a distribution of Linux designed to run containers in Docker in the
most secure way possible. PCD only defines opinions about the container runtime
and the fewest possible supporting components.</p>

</section>

<section><h2 id="why">Why</h2>

<p>After learning about CoreOS, and then Rancher, I had different opinions
about what is needed to support Docker containers. I didn't want to be tied to
the opinions of any other minimal container operating system.

</section>

<section><h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>

<p>The base system is build to run entirely from RAM. The drives in the system
are only persistent data from containers and booting.

<p>The first partition on the system is 200MB. This partition is marked
bootable and has the grub bootloader installed. This should leave room for a
primary and backup kernel and allow future room for expansion.

<p>The second partition is used for Docker images, containers, and any shared
directories. This partition is automatically expanded at boot if needed.

<p>The system uses the runit version in busybox for PID 1.

</section>

<section><h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p><b>Cloud provider and hardware agnostic.</b>
No dependencies on anything provided by a particular vendor, cloud or hardware.

<p><b>Easy upgrades.</b>
Currently, this is simply running the installer again.

<p><b>Minimal components to run Docker.</b>
Only the absolute necessary components are used. There is no
<a href="https://blog.qualys.com/laws-of-vulnerabilities/2015/01/27/the-ghost-vulnerability">glibc</a>,
<a href="http://heartbleed.com/">openssl</a>,
<a href="http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q3/650">bash</a>, or
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/07/bug-in-widely-used-openssh-opens-servers-to-password-cracking/">openssh</a>.
In fact, the only SSL implementation used is the implementation from Go in
the Docker Engine itself.

<section><h2 id="using">Using</h2>

<h3>ISO</h3>

<p>Perhaps the easiest usage is with the official ISO distribution. Simply boot
this and run.

<h3>Kernel</h3>

<p>The more versatile distribution is the raw kernel image with included
initramfs. This is the only file needed for PXE booting.

<h3>Vagrant box</h3>

<p>There is a
<a href="https://github.com/brimstone/pcd/blob/master/Vagrantfile">
Vagrantfile</a> included with the source project that can be used as-is, or as
a base for other vagrant projects.
